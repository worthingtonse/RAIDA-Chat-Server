# RAIDA-Chat-Server RAFTS (Redundant Arrays of File Transfer Servers
Allows anyone to create a chat server that people use as one of their RAIDA Chat Servers.

RAIDA Chat shreds data into many stripes that are routed to many "Chat Servers."  These Chat servers actually tranmit any files. So 
it may be more appropriate to call them a RAIDA File Transfer Server or a Redundant Array of File Transfer Servers RAFTS.

## Overview of operations

RAFTS will register themselves with as many RAIDA Realms as they choose. Realms will make the RAFTS servers as either trusted or not 
trusted. RAFTS owners can describe their servers to the Realm so that its users will know something about them. 

Users of RAIDA Realms will be able to see download a list of the Chat Servers that are registered with the Realm Controller. They can then choose all the RAFTS servers they want. The more they choose, the higher the    shredding of data and the faster the transfer. However, in order for users to use these servers, they must be paid for. 


Users who have the Advanced Client software will be able to contact as many RAFTS as they want ,  and create an account using a CloudCoin that they set aside for the RAFTS. They then must upload CloudCoins into the RAFTS in order to get GBs of data. As data is transferred from their computers, the GBs go down until they must
re-charge the accounts with CloudCoins. 

In order to use the RAFTS, the users must also create an account with a RAIDA Realm 

## Requirements

The RAFTS must have a file that lists all the RAIDA Realms / RAIDA Controllers the Chat server has an account on. On
startup, the RAFTS will login to the RAIDA Controllers using a 250 CloudCoin as a ID. Therefor, the 
RAFTS must have a 250 CloudCoin note in their ID folder. The RAFTS will not store any data an therefor need not have vast 
storage requirements. They will need to move GB of data and good bandwidth. They will need to handle web socket connections. 

The RAFTS are not allowed to store user data or record when and where data was sent or received. Otherwise, they will become targets for those looking for that type of information.
